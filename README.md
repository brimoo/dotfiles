# My Linux Dotfiles
This repo contains some of my configuration files for my current
Linux installation. The main purpose of this repo is to have a backup of my config files in case I brick my system :) I'm running Manjaro right now, but that could change and so could any one of my configuration files. I'll try to keep this up to date if/when I change configurations or add new ones.

## How to Use
You can simply drop the contents of this repo straight into `~/.config`, the only exception is my .zshrc which must be put in the home directory. Note that my neovim configuration might be a little out of date since I don't use neovim much these days.
