# My Linux Dotfiles
This repo contains some of my configuration files for my current
Linux installation. The main purpose of this repo is to have a backup of my config files in case I brick my system :). I'm running Manjaro right now, but that could change and so could any one of my configuration files. I'll try to keep this up to date if/when I change configurations or add new ones.
